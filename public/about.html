<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Andrea. I live in the Mid-west of the United States of America. I
  have a dog.
</p>

<p>
  I am learning to code, so I can make money. I also look forward to expressing
  my creativity through this new skill.
</p>

<p>
  I don't like the cold. Snow is pretty, but only 2 to 3 times per year.
  Vacations are fun. Exploration expands the soul.
